        <p>
       My research interests include philosophy of machine learning, ethics of AI, cognitive science, general philosophy of science, normativity, pragmatism, and feminist philosophy. My most recent work focuses on what current advances in deep learning mean for standard causal tracking theories of content in connectionist models. I am also interested in the normativity of beliefs and belief acquisition. Here I adopt a broadly pragmatist approach to the normative significance behind notions of truth and reason-giving as they relate to scientific explanation.

    <p> <h3>Deepening Representational Similarity</i></h3>   

       Abstract: Mounting empirical evidence suggests that connectionists models are useful tools for learning about regions of interest in the brain. Even so, connectionism is not without its skeptics. Criticism that connectionist models cannot teach us about cognition stems, in part, from a lack of clarity about how these models explain. But, a lack of precision in how content is to be identified in connectionist models must also share in the blame. Our thinking about content in these models needs to be brought up to date with our evidential situation. This means bringing modern advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence to bear on existing theories of content in connectionist models. In this paper, I explore the worry that existing attempts to ground objective, contentful explantions of connectionist models in cluster analysis may fail to generalize well to deep learning models with many thousands of dimensions. I canvas some of the problems with identifying clusters as the vehicles of content high-dimensional state space and argue that we should instead look to tools for representational similarity analysis used in contemporary neuroscience to identify contentful explanations of connectionist models.

        <h3>Permission to Believe at Will </i></h3>   

       Abstract: According to doxastic involuntarism, we cannot believe at will. In this paper, I argue that permissivism, the view that, at times, there is more than one way to respond rationally to a given body of evidence, is consistent with doxastic involuntarism. Roeber (2019a, 2019b) argues that, since permissive situations are possible, cognitively healthy agents can believe at will. Roeberâ€™s argument invokes a generic treatment of permissivism, but the two key premises in his argument depend on different versions of permissivism. Attending to these subtle differences reveals a dilemma. Roeber can opt to defend either a version of permissivism that supports his first premise or one that supports the second. If he chooses the former, then the second premise turns out to be false. If he endorses the latter, then the first premise is false. In either case, the argument from permissive situations is unsound.
