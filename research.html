        <p>
       My research interests include philosophy of machine learning and its intersections with cognitive neuroscience, general philosophy of science, ethics, and social epistemology. I am also interested pragmatism, feminist philosophy, and the normativity of beliefs and belief acquisition. My most recent work focuses on what current advances in deep learning mean for standard causal tracking theories of content in connectionist models.

    <p> <h3>Deepening Representations</i></h3> 


    There is a vast literature in cognitive science and empirical philosophy of mind concerning whether connectionist models can provide explanations in terms of representational content. Critics have claimed that connectionist networks cannot provide properly psychological explanations, since there is no principled way to group tokened representations into types that share the same content. Despite the volume of ink spilled over this debate, very little has been said about representational content in state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs). While these networks can be viewed as extensions of early connectionist models, their added complexity introduces a number of complications. This paper brings modern advances in machine learning and computer vision to bear on the question of content in connectionist networks. I consider what I call the cluster approach, which I take to be the strongest account of content in connectionist systems. I show that technical problems arise when generalizing this approach to DNNs. I then offer a positive proposal for ascribing content to DNNs inspired by recent developments in computational neuroscience, which retains the spirit of the cluster approach while avoiding the same technical worries.

        <h3>Permission to Believe at Will </i></h3>   

       According to doxastic involuntarism, we cannot believe at will. In this paper, I argue that permissivism, the view that, at times, there is more than one way to respond rationally to a given body of evidence, is consistent with doxastic involuntarism. Blake Roeber (2019a,b) argues that, since permissive situations are possible, cognitively healthy agents can believe at will. However, Roeber (2019b) fails to distinguish between two different arguments for voluntarism, both of which can be show to fail by proper attention to different accounts of permissivism. Roeber considers a generic treatment of permissivism, but key premises in both arguments depend on different, more particular notions of permissivism. Attending to these differences reveals that the inference from permissivism to voluntarism to be unwarranted.
