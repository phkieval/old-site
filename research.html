        <p>
       My research interests include philosophy of machine learning, ethics of AI, cognitive science, general philosophy of science, normativity, pragmatism, and feminist philosophy. My most recent work focuses on what current advances in deep learning mean for standard causal tracking theories of content in connectionist models. I am also interested in the normativity of beliefs and belief acquisition. Here I adopt a broadly pragmatist approach to the normative significance of truth and reason-giving as they relate to scientific explanation.

    <p> <h3>Deepening Representations</i></h3> 


 There is a vast literature in cognitive science and empirical philosophy of mind concerning whether connectionist models can provide explanations in terms of representational content. Critics have claimed that connectionist networks cannot provide properly psychological explanations, since there is no principled way to group tokened representations into types that share the same content. Despite the volume of ink spilled over this debate, very little has been said about representational content in state-of-the-art deep neural networks (DNNs). While these networks can be viewed as extensions of early connectionist models, their added complexity introduces a number of complications. This paper brings modern advances in machine learning and computer vision to bear on the question of content in connectionist networks. I consider what I call the cluster approach, which I take to be the strongest account of content in connectionist systems. I show that technical problems arise when generalizing this approach to DNNs. I then offer a positive proposal for ascribing content to DNNs inspired by recent developments in computational neuroscience, which retains the spirit of the cluster approach while avoiding the same technical worries.

        <h3>Permission to Believe at Will </i></h3>   

       According to doxastic involuntarism, we cannot believe at will. In this paper, I argue that permissivism, the view that, at times, there is more than one way to respond rationally to a given body of evidence, is consistent with doxastic involuntarism. Roeber (2019a, 2019b) argues that, since permissive situations are possible, cognitively healthy agents can believe at will. Roeberâ€™s argument invokes a generic treatment of permissivism, but the two key premises in his argument depend on different versions of permissivism. Attending to these subtle differences reveals a dilemma. Roeber can opt to defend either a version of permissivism that supports his first premise or one that supports the second. If he chooses the former, then the second premise turns out to be false. If he endorses the latter, then the first premise is false. In either case, the argument from permissive situations is unsound.
