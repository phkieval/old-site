      My primary research interests concern the philosophy of machine learning and its intersections with cognitive science, philosophy of neuroscience, philosophy of biology, general philosophy of science, ethics, and public policy. I am also interested in social and normative epistemology, pragmatism, and feminist philosophy.

    <p> <h3>Mapping representational spaces with deep neural networks</i></h3> 


   The predominance of machine learning (ML) based techniques in cognitive neuroscience raises a host of philosophical and methodological concerns. Given the messiness of neural activity, modellers must make choices about how to structure their raw data to make inferences about encoded representations. This leads to a set of standard methodological assumptions about when abstraction is appropriate in neuroscientific practice. But when made uncritically these choices threaten to bias conclusions about phenomena drawn from data. Contact between the practices of multivariate pattern analysis (MVPA) and philosophy of science can help to illuminate the conditions under which we can safely rely on artificial neural networks (ANNs) to generate sound transitions from data to phenomena. This paper considers a specific technique for MVPA called representational similarity analysis (RSA). I develop a theoretically-informed account of RSA that draws on early connectionist research and work on idealization in the philosophy of science. By bringing a philosophical account of cognitive modelling in conversation with RSA, this paper clarifies the practices of neuroscientists and provides a generalizable framework for using ANNs to study cogntivie mechanisms in the brain.

        <h3>Dimensionality Reduction as Functional Decomposition  </i></h3>   

       The brain transforms input signal from rich, multi-modal sensory stimuli to produce either behavior or output signal for use by further downstream processes. Cognitive neuroscientists are in the business of probing patterns of neural activity in search of the representations over which these computations are performed. Yet, both artificial and biological neural networks conisist in massively many parameters resulting in computations being performed in exceedingly an high-dimensional space. As such, neuroscientists must take steps to address the curse of dimensionality---a set of problems that emerge when analyzing data in high-dimensional spaces that otherwise would not occur in low-dimensional spaces like those of ordinary three-dimensional experience. Typically this involves various forms of dimensionality reduction, normalization, and implicit assumptions about the distrubtion of noise. Yet, the theoretical importance of these modelling choices are rarely discussed by the modellers themselves. This paper argues that much of the interesting work in an analysis of neural activity is actually being done by early choices that modellers make to structure their raw data. This phenomena is especially embodied by the choice of dimensionality reduction. These choices are justifiable in terms of a search for idealized, causal patterns that arise from the underlying neural data.

        <h3>Permission to Believe at Will </i></h3>   

       According to doxastic involuntarism, we cannot believe at will. In this paper, I argue that permissivism, the view that, at times, there is more than one way to respond rationally to a given body of evidence, is consistent with doxastic involuntarism. Blake Roeber (2019a,b) argues that, since permissive situations are possible, cognitively healthy agents can believe at will. However, Roeber (2019b) fails to distinguish between two different arguments for voluntarism, both of which can be shown to fail by proper attention to different accounts of permissivism. Roeber considers a generic treatment of permissivism, but key premises in both arguments depend on different, more particular notions of permissivism. Attending to these differences reveals that the inference from permissivism to voluntarism to be unwarranted.
