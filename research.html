        <p>
       My research interests include philosophy of machine learning, ethics of AI, cognitive science, general philosophy of science, normativity, pragmatism, and feminist philosophy. My most recent work focuses on what current advances in deep learning mean for standard causal tracking theories of content in connectionist models. I am also interested in the normativity of beliefs and belief acquisition. Here I adopt a broadly pragmatist approach to the normative significance of truth and reason-giving as they relate to scientific explanation.

    <p> <h3>Deepening Representational Similarity</i></h3> 


  Connectionists hope to explain cognition using artificial neural networks as models. Connectionist networks consist in large collections of artificial neurons called units or nodes together with weights that measure the strength of connections between nodes. We can view these networks as models of the neurons and synaptic links in the brain at some level of abstraction. Critics charge that connectionist networks cannot provide a psychological explanation of behavior, since there is no principled way to separate internal representations into groups which share the same content. A prominent response to this objection claims that clusters of activity in state space are the vehicles of content in connectionist models. This paper brings advances in deep learning to bear on that proposal. I explore the worry that attempts to individuate content in connectionist models using cluster analysis may fail to generalize well to deep neural networks with many thousands of dimensions. I canvas some of the problems with identifying clusters as the vehicles of content in high-dimensional state space and argue that we should instead look to tools for representational similarity analysis used in computational neuroscience to identify contentful explanations of connectionist models.

        <h3>Permission to Believe at Will </i></h3>   

       According to doxastic involuntarism, we cannot believe at will. In this paper, I argue that permissivism, the view that, at times, there is more than one way to respond rationally to a given body of evidence, is consistent with doxastic involuntarism. Roeber (2019a, 2019b) argues that, since permissive situations are possible, cognitively healthy agents can believe at will. Roeberâ€™s argument invokes a generic treatment of permissivism, but the two key premises in his argument depend on different versions of permissivism. Attending to these subtle differences reveals a dilemma. Roeber can opt to defend either a version of permissivism that supports his first premise or one that supports the second. If he chooses the former, then the second premise turns out to be false. If he endorses the latter, then the first premise is false. In either case, the argument from permissive situations is unsound.
