        <p> Beginning in the Fall, I will be a PhD student in the Department of History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Cambridge where I am generously funded by the <a target = "_blank" href=https://www.gatescambridge.org/biography/18408/">Gates Cambridge Scholarship</a>. 

        My interests lie primarily in the philosophy of articial intelligence, general philosophy of science, cognitive science, pragmatism, feminist philosophy, and epistemic normativity. I'm also interested in machine learning's role in our epistemic systems, especially with respect to public discourse about science and politics. 

        Before Cambridge I was a student at the University of Houston where I earned my BA and MA in Philosophy.

        <p>
      My most recent work focuses on the structure and content of representations in deep neural networks. State-of-the-art machine learning systems are ubiquitous in modern life. Deep neural networks exhibit a remarkable level of predictive success worthy of the popular label of artificial intelligence (AI). These systems find applications in everything from automated decision assistance in medicine and criminal justice to playing board games like chess and Go. Our epistemic networks are increasingly intertwined with machine learning algorithms, and scientists rely on them in complex computational models. However, deep learning systems are opaque in ways that make explaining their capacities intractable. Philosophers of science are uniquely positioned to investigate critical questions concerning the widespread implementation of machine learning systems. How can deep neural networks teach us about the brain? How do these models generate explanations in science? To what extent does science demand transparency in AI? How should rapid technological advancements in AI inform public policy? How can we promote more humane and egalitarian implementations of AI in public life? I am optimistic that we can glean some answers to these questions by investigating how deep learning systems learn and exploit representations.
